Translation status
------------------

* Any new translations are welcome.

* These translations are incomplete: Danish, Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese,
	Russian, Swedish, and Turkish.

* The French translation needs editing and confirmation.

Known bugs
----------

* Many GTK+ themes using the "smooth" engine (e.g. Amaranth, Lush, Nuvola)
	have issues with button colours. This is worked around with a substandard
	solution (overriding the entire style).

* Under KDE's gtk-qt-engine, no button colours appear at all.

If you are affected by a button colour issue and your GTK+ theme (shown
in the Controls tab of the GNOME Theme Preferences) is not listed here,
please report it to me.

* When restoring table or list state, radio menu items for properties are not
	re-selected.

Data set issues
---------------

* The discovery, discovered_by, and etymology properties need to be overlayed
	with BODR's discoveryDate, discoverers, discoveryCountry, and nameorigin
	data.

* These Element properties do not have confirmed sources: appearance,
	atomic_volume, ionic_radii (also needs reformatting), oxidation_states,
	debye_temperature.

* Potential additions from BODR: all data in isotopes/, densities (unsourced,
	different model).

* Potential additions from Wikipedia data: additional ionisation energies,
	critical points, vapour pressures, electrical resistivities, thermal
	expansion coefficients, speeds of sound, elastic properties, hardnesses,
	abundances, element images

Other enhancements
------------------

* Provide more explanatory property descriptions.
* Improve get_phase algorithm with more data points.
* Preserve precision in floating-point values.
* Provide for logical translation of data source messages.
* Allow translation/addition of alternate names.

* Add optional view persistence via GConf.

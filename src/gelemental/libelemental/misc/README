libmisc is an assortment of code for reuse. This is a libtool convenience
library which includes macros, functions, and classes which I use in multiple
gtkmm projects.

libmisc is not intended for separate distribution; the variables
LIBMISC_CPPFLAGS, LIBMISC_CXXFLAGS, and optionally LIBMISC_LIBS should be
provided by the including package's configure, minimally including flags for
glibmm-2.4.

For the gtkmm widgets in libmisc-gtk, the LIBMISC_GTK Automake variable should
be set and the flags for gtkmm-2.4 should be included.

libmisc includes a modified version of the compose library by Ole Laursen. This
has been relicensed under the GPL; the original library is available under the
LGPL, with documentation, at <http://people.iola.dk/olau/compose/>.

libmisc is free software released under the GNU General Public License, version
